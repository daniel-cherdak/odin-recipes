        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            This baked salmon is a great recipe for beginners. This was my first time making fish and it was a hit. Even my 9-year-old daughter who wouldn't ever dream of eating fish had half of my portion!
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>6 tablespoons light olive oil</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon lemon juice</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon fresh parsley, chopped</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 fillets salmon</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Whisk olive oil, garlic, lemon juice, parsley, basil, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl.</li>
            <li>Arrange salmon fillets in a small glass or ceramic baking dish; pour marinade over salmon. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for about 1 hour, turning occasionally.</li>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).            </li>
            <li>Transfer salmon fillets onto a large piece of aluminum foil; spoon marinade on top and fold up the foil to seal. Place sealed salmon on a baking sheet, and bake in preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 35 to 45 minutes.</li>
        </ol>
